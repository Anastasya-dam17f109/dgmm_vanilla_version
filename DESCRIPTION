Description: Deep Gaussian mixture models are a generalization of classical Gaussian mixtures 
    to multiple layers Cinzia and McLachlan (2019)<doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9793-z>.
    Each layer contain a set of latent variables that follow a  mixture of Gaussian distributions. 
    To avoid overparameterized solutions, dimension reduction is applied at each layer by way of factor models.
